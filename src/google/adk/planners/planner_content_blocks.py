"""Standardized content blocks for planner output.

Planners such as
:class:`~google.adk.planners.plan_re_act_planner.PlanReActPlanner` and
:class:`~google.adk.planners.built_in_planner.BuiltInPlanner` produce their
output as a list of ``google.genai.types.Part`` objects. Reasoning is signalled
on those parts with ``thought=True`` and, for ``PlanReActPlanner``, the text is
additionally annotated with inline ``/*PLANNING*/`` style tags that callers have
to parse themselves.

This module provides a small, additive helper that converts that ``Part`` list
into a provider-agnostic, structured representation modelled after LangChain
v1's standard content blocks
(https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/messages#standard-content-blocks),
so that consumers can branch on a typed ``type`` discriminator instead of
re-parsing raw text.

The helper is read-only: it never mutates the parts it is given and it does not
change anything about how planners build instructions or post-process responses.
Existing consumers that rely on the ``Part`` output are unaffected.
